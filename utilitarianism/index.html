                Utilitarianism is an ethical theory which bases the morality of actions on their consequences, more specifically in terms of happiness and suffering. It was developed mainly by the philosopher John Stuart Mill in the late 18th century. The main principle that utilitarianism stands on is the Greatest Happiness Principle – which states that an action is deemed morally correct if it entails the greatest overall happiness for the greatest number of people.

                Utilitarianism, just like any other moral philosophy, has its own strengths and drawbacks. Utilitarianism holds strongly in decisions where actions are needed which will benefit the majority of people. A strength of this philosophy is that it promotes and emphasizes the strength of impartiality in decision making. However, a criticism that is held for this philosophy is the fact that happiness is quantified subjectively – it is not an item which can be objectively measured or weighted. Additionally, it may overlook the rights of individuals in favor of the majority.

                Pratty, a 30-year-old woman, is in an abusive relationship with her partner, Arjun. Over time, her family and friends notice signs of physical and emotional harm. Despite their concern, Pratty repeatedly defends Arjun and refuses to leave the relationship, insisting that she loves him and that things will improve.
            </p>
            <p class="scenario-text">
                One day, Pratty's close friend, Mahika, discovers that Arjun has escalated the abuse, threatening Pratty's life during an argument. Pratty, however, still refuses to report Arjun to the authorities or seek help. Mahika must now decide whether to intervene by reporting the situation to the police, possibly against Pratty's wishes, or to respect Pratty's autonomy and allow her to decide how to handle her relationship.

                Utilitarianism is a theory of ethics based on choosing actions that maximize happiness for the largest amount of people. Mahika, in this case, needs to make a decision between respecting Pratty's autonomy or reporting Arjun in a bid to protect her. In the event that Mahika stays silent, Pratty may continue suffering, and abuse may continue being carried out, ultimately resulting in harm and even death. This would not be a happy solution—Pratty would remain in danger, and her loved ones would be helpless and worried. Or, reporting Arjun could involve the police, which would save Pratty's life and prevent further harm. Even if Pratty is upset at first, stopping the abuse would generate the most overall happiness.
                <br><br>
                From the utilitarian perspective, the right thing for Mahika to do is to report Arjun to the police. Even though Pratty suffers in the short term, her well-being and safety are more important than her temporary ordeal. Furthermore, stopping Arjun from injuring others in the future is a greater good. If Mahika does not intervene, the abuse can continue or even worsen, bringing more suffering. In doing something, she maximizes happiness and reduces harm, which is utilitarian. Reporting Arjun is therefore the ethical action because it promotes the best for Pratty and those who care about her.

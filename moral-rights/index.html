                Moral Rights Theory is based on the idea that individuals have rights that are basic to humankind and must be respected, regardless of any consequences. This theory was developed by Immanuel Kant in the 18th century, and he deemed that moral actions should be based on duty rather than outcomes. His Categorical Imperative states that actions are ethical when they can be universally applied and treat individuals as ends rather than means.

                Some strengths of this philosophy include that it protects individual freedoms and prevents exploitation of minorities and underrepresented groups. However, Moral Rights Theory is completely blind to consequences and can also lead to conflicts between different rights that people hold.

                Pratty, a 30-year-old woman, is in an abusive relationship with her partner, Arjun. Over time, her family and friends notice signs of physical and emotional harm. Despite their concern, Pratty repeatedly defends Arjun and refuses to leave the relationship, insisting that she loves him and that things will improve.
            </p>
            <p class="scenario-text">
                One day, Pratty's close friend, Mahika, discovers that Arjun has escalated the abuse, threatening Pratty's life during an argument. Pratty, however, still refuses to report Arjun to the authorities or seek help. Mahika must now decide whether to intervene by reporting the situation to the police, possibly against Pratty's wishes, or to respect Pratty's autonomy and allow her to decide how to handle her relationship.

                Moral rights are fundamental rights possessed by every human being, and they must be respected regardless of the circumstances. In this case, Pratty has a right to autonomy, which means she should be capable of making decisions on her own, including staying with Arjun. Autonomy is not complete, however, especially if one is in danger. If Pratty is unable to make sensible decisions because of fear, manipulation, or psychological distress, then she might not be fully capable of making a safe decision.
                <br><br>
                Mahika, on the other hand, has the moral obligation to stop Pratty from coming to harm. She could end up being a willing participant in letting abuse happen, which could eventually lead to the victim suffering severe injury or death. From the point of view of moral rights, the right of protection and non-corruption overshadows the right to autonomy where someone is very likely to be seriously harmed. The action by Mahika is conflicting to the wishes of Pratty at that immediate moment but insures her basic right of being safe. Eventually, in the long run, Pratty could value the fact that Mahika saved her life. Respecting autonomy is vital, but where a person's life is threatened, the moral obligation to save them outweighs it.

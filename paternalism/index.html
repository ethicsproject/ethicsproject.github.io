                Paternalism is an ethical principle which justifies the restriction of individual autonomy to protect a person's well-being, assuming the fact that people may not always make rational or well-informed choices for themselves. This idea was detailed by John Stuart Mill. Paternalism can often be observed in laws which are designed to protect people from harm - such as mandatory seatbelt laws and regulations on drugs/alcohol.

                The strengths of paternalism are held in the fact that it promotes societal welfare as well as protects individuals from harm. However, it can restrict personal freedom, rights, and autonomy, and assumes that the government or authority figures always know what is best.

                Pratty, a 30-year-old woman, is in an abusive relationship with her partner, Arjun. Over time, her family and friends notice signs of physical and emotional harm. Despite their concern, Pratty repeatedly defends Arjun and refuses to leave the relationship, insisting that she loves him and that things will improve.
            </p>
            <p class="scenario-text">
                One day, Pratty's close friend, Mahika, discovers that Arjun has escalated the abuse, threatening Pratty's life during an argument. Pratty, however, still refuses to report Arjun to the authorities or seek help. Mahika must now decide whether to intervene by reporting the situation to the police, possibly against Pratty's wishes, or to respect Pratty's autonomy and allow her to decide how to handle her relationship.

                Paternalism is the  idea  that  it is  sometimes  right  to  intervene  in  someone's  decisions  for their own good, even  when  the  person  does  not wish intervention. In this case, Pratty refuses to  abandon  Arjun or  turn  him  in, but Mahika knows that staying in the relationship puts her in serious danger. If Mahika respects Pratty's decision and does nothing, she risks allowing the abuse to continue, which  can  lead to severe harm or  death. Pratty may believe she is making the best  decision  for herself, but her judgment is clouded by fear, emotional  involvement, and manipulation  on  Arjun's behalf. Since she is in immediate danger and  is  unable to  defend  herself, paternalism would argue that Mahika has a moral duty to  act,  regardless  of  whether  Pratty  wants  her to  or not.
                <br><br>
                From  the  paternalistic perspective, the right thing to do is for Mahika to report Arjun to the police  despite  Pratty's  disapproval.  The  reason  being  that  Mahika is acting in  the  best interest  of Pratty, protecting her from further harm when she is unable to do  this  herself.  Pratty might,  at  first,  be  betrayed  or  angered,  but  her  safety  takes  precedence  over  respecting her short-term desires. In the long run,  when  she is out of danger, she may  understand  that Mahika's actions saved her. Paternalism justifies  intervention  when  an  individual  is at risk of  significant  harm, so Mahika should intervene,  making  Pratty  secure  even if it  goes  against her current wishes.

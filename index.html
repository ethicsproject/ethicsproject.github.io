            <p class="real-life-description">
                As of 2025, the Trump has ordered to stop the minting of new pennies in light of its cost of production. By 2011 it is stated that it costs 3.7 cents to produce a coin worth 1 cent. In an attempt to cut down on costs, the only way to do so is to stop production entirely, as the cost of the materials used changes. “The U.S. Mint reported losing $85.3 million in the 2024 fiscal year that ended in September on the nearly 3.2 billion pennies it produced. Every <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/it-cost-1-5-cents-to-make-a-penny-last-year/" target="_blank">penny</a> cost nearly $0.037 — up from $0.031 the year before.” (CBS news 2025).  
                <br><br>
                In a similar light, the cost of producing a nickel, “is worth half as much as a dime but costs twice as much to mint” (Blatt 2025).

                How would each theory approach the ethical question of the penny?
